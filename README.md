# Exercise 2: modelling image manipulations

You have to implement an API in your language to expose image manipulation functionality.
This API must implement the following operations:

- Flip an image
- Rotate an image
- Crop an image
- Blend two different images, as long as coloured images cannot be mixed with
black&white ones (and vice versa).

You have to implement a code that provides, in your opinion, the most convenient API to
perform such actions.
